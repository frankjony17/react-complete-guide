## JS Array Functions
Not really next-gen JavaScript, but also important: JavaScript array functions like map() , filter() , reduce()  etc.

You'll see me use them quite a bit since a lot of React concepts rely on working with arrays (in immutable ways).

The following page gives a good overview over the various methods you can use on the array prototype - feel free to click through them and refresh your knowledge as required: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array

### Particularly important in this course are:

- map()  => https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/map
- find()  => https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/find
- findIndex()  => https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/findIndex
- filter()  => https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/filter
- reduce()  => https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/Reduce?v=b
- concat()  => https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/concat?v=b
- slice()  => https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/slice
- splice()  => https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/splice
